# Meta analysis as a method to pool together evidences of previous studies.

# Fixed-effect meta-analysis
# Assumption: there is a fixed underlying effect, which does not change across the studies

1. $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$ be the effect and the standard error of the i-th study
2. $w_i$ as weight assigned to this study is $\frac{1}{v_i}$, where $v_i$ is the varaince ($\sigma^2$)
3. the weighted effect $\hat{\mu}$ equals $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k}{w_i \mu_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_i}$
4. the weighted variance $\hat{v}$ equals $\frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_i}$
5. the weighted effect is the combined effect, with standard error $\sqrt{\hat{v}}$

# Random-effect meta-analysis
# Assumption: there is no fixed underlying effect, instead effects are study-specific

There are two levels of sampling, and two source of error: 
1, the true effect sizes Î¸ are distributed about $\mu$ of each study with a variance $\tau^2$, which reflects the actual distribution of the true effects about their mean; 
2, the observed effect $\mu_i$ for the i-th study is distributed about that $\mu_i$ with a variance $\sigma_i^2$, which depends primarily on the sample size for that study. 

Random effects analysis decomposes variance into the two parts, within-studies $\sigma^2$ and between-studies $\tau^2$, and
then use both parts when assigning the weights. 

The formulas are quite tedious, detailed in $meta.pdf$.
