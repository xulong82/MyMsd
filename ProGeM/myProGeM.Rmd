## Key conclusions

1. Geonomic proximity is the most reliable indicator of true positive causal genes: 69% sensitivity and 95% specificity
2. cis-eQTL data led to 3 false positive assignments for every 1 positive assignment: 25% specificity and 56% sensitivity

ProGeM performances for 227 mQTL with high-confidence causal gene assignments

> Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)
> Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)

                          Sensitivity      Specificity
-----------------------   --------------   ----------------
Bottom-up                 95%              38%
Top-down                  85%              46%
Bottom-up or top-down     98%              50%
Bottom-up and top-down    82%              85%
Nearest gene              69%              95%
Sentinel cis-eQTL         56%              75%
---------  ------------   --------------   ----------------

> How did they use the cis-eQTL data?
> Simply asking whether the sentinel variant was significant for the gene w/o considering whether the variant was the top in the eQTL signal?
