## Normal and Chi-squared models

The square of a standard normal variable follows $\chi^2$ with 1 df. 
So, the probability of seeing another $z$ that is more extreme than the given $z$ under the null hypothesis of a standard normal equals to the probability of seeing another $z^2$ that is more extrem of the given $z^2$ under the null hypothesis of a $\chi^2$. 

```{r}

z = rnorm(10, 0, 1)
z.p = 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z)))

z.c = 1 - pchisq(z^2, df = 1)

plot(z.p, z.c)
```
